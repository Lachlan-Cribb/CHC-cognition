This project uses cognitive test data from a range of cognitive tests and combines them into the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) taxonomy of human intelligence. The model is estimated using confirmatory factor analysis in R package Lavaan. 

### Running the code

Prior to executing the code, the required packages may need to be installed. The install.packages() function is used to install a package, with the package name given in quotes. You only need to do this once. For example, 

  ```sh
  install.packages("lavaan")
  ```

Then, the package is loaded using the library command: 
  
  ```sh
  library("lavaan")
  ```
